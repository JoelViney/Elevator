# Elevator
 
The elevator algorithm, a simple algorithm by which a single elevator can decide where to stop, is summarised as follows:

Continue travelling in the same direction while there are remaining requests in that same direction.
If there are no further requests in that direction, then stop and become idle, or change direction if there are requests in the opposite direction.
